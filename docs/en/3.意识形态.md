# Ideologies

The time economy only changes the rules of currency issuance; its superstructure is free, so it can be paired with various ideologies.

## Marxism, Socialism, Communism

> **Currency value bound to labor; the right to issue currency belongs to workers**

The core of the time economy is to bind power to currency and to bind currency issuance to labor. This returns power to the proletariat of labor and uses the power of the market to [eliminate exploitation and reform private ownership](2.优势.md).

During the [transitional stage](1.规则/1.2.延伸规则.md#public-power), the time economy still requires a transitional government of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which aligns with the theory of socialist construction.

Due to its decentralized characteristics, the time economy makes the withering away of the state possible. In addition, the extinction of currency will be a [natural economic process](2.优势.md#deflation), providing a natural progression toward the realization of communism.

## Liberalism

> **The right to issue currency is a basic human freedom**

The time economy has [self-stabilization](2.优势.md#decentralization), using the market rather than planning; it does not itself require a strong authority to force people to follow rules, because people mutually constrain one another.

All contemporary democratic systems have delays and suffer from the fatal flaw of "reliance on potentially corrupt government power." The time economy goes a step further in democracy by adopting **real-time democracy**, where any citizen's appeals can be quickly resolved through currency taxation and abolition, without relying on administrative power.

## Neoliberalism

> **Currency is power; marketization of currency is democracy**

Neoliberalism advocates a free market, and the time economy is even more thorough: it abolishes the state's monopoly on currency issuance. Economist Hayek also argued that currency should be denationalized.

Any neoliberal would appreciate that currency issuance should be fully marketized.

## Anarchism

> **The market is the only effective form of decentralization**

The time economy is formed by the market and possesses [decentralization](2.优势.md#decentralization), making it naturally suitable for anarchists. Through currency and the market, the time economy stabilizes society, making stability under anarchism possible.
