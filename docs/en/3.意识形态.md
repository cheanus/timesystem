# Ideologies

The time economy only changes the rules of currency issuance, and its upper-level structure is free, so it can be compatible with various ideologies.

## Marxism, Socialism, Communism

The core of the time economy is to bind power to currency and currency issuance to labor, thus returning power to the propertyless class of laborers and using the power of the market to [eliminate exploitation and reform private ownership](2.优势.md).

In the [transition stage](1.规则/1.2.延伸规则.md#public-power), the time economy still requires a transitional government of the propertyless class, which aligns with the theory of socialist construction.

Due to its decentralized nature, the time economy makes the disappearance of government possible. In addition, currency extinction will be a [natural economic process](2.优势.md#deflation), providing a natural path for the realization of communism.

## Liberalism

The time economy possesses [self-stabilization](2.优势.md#decentralization), using the market rather than planning, and does not require a strong power to force the people to complete various rules, as people mutually constrain each other.

All contemporary democracies have delays, and their stability has the fatal flaw of "relying on potentially corrupt government power." The time economy goes a step further in democracy, adopting **real-time democracy**, where any citizen's appeal can be quickly resolved through currency taxation and abolition, without relying on administrative power.

## Neoliberalism

Neoliberalism advocates a free market, and the time economy is even more thorough, abolishing the monopoly of state-issued currency. Economist Hayek also believed that currency should be denationalized.

Any neoliberal would appreciate that currency issuance should be fully marketized—**currency is power, and marketization of currency is democracy**.

## Anarchism

The time economy has the characteristics of [decentralization](2.优势.md#decentralization), making it naturally suitable for anarchists. Through currency and the market, the time economy stabilizes society, making stability under anarchism possible.
